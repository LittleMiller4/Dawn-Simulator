 Through the use of an Arduino, a clock shield(for info, see https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Starter_Shield), a MOSFET, and a bit of code, we have basically replaced the need for sun!
 If you live in a place where the sun likes to slack seasonally or you just like to build things that light up at a certain time, then this little trinket is the thing for you.


                #HOW TO GET THIS LITTLE GUY GOING#
    This isn't going to be a full tutorial(yet). I shall only cover the software aspect of the Dawn-Simulator and that will be brief. (It is recommended that you have some knowledge of arduinos and their activities.)

1. You shall download the needed libraries from https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Starter_Shield and include them in the Arduino IDE.
2. Download ze files from above.
3. Plug in and enjoy! (OK, not quite but it is pretty self explanatory.)

Questions? Concerns? Snide remarks? Send me(Joel) a message! @LittleMiller4
